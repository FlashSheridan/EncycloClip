= Release Notes for 1.0.3 2016/07/22=
i.eb.com now requires an academic subscription, so use www.britannica.com instead.

=1.0.2 2016/07/22=
The old Britannica URL now only works for those with an academic subscription.  I've created a version with the new URL, but am struggling with the iTunes Store red tape.

=1.0.2 2016/02/09=
Fixed version (for iOS 8.3 or later) posted on iTunes Store.  The first two devices for which I tried to download the upgrade actually got the earlier version, but this seemed to be fixed for the next two devices.

=1.0.1 2016/01/30=
Aborts on launch on iOS 9 due to a warning that was promoted to an error.  I have submitted a fix to the iTunes Store (which won't let me note the incompatibility in the description).

* No code changes; just added explicit iPad compatibility, which doesn't make much difference for a faceless app.  The only visible difference is that you shouldn't see the brief iPhone-sized outline when you launch it on an iPad.

=0.0b2 2010/05/17=
* No code changes; just worked around XCode code-signing error -19011 (ticket 104626706) by booting from a fresh partition and using an older version of XCode (3.2.2, SDK 3.1.3).

=0.0b0 2010/04/21=
* My wife thinks the icon is lame.
* It doesn't say that it supports the iPad, though it works on mine.  The Britannica web site only uses part of the iPad screen, however.  (I got bitten by an apparent SDK conversion bug, and reverted to the pre-iPad version.)
* No genre.

=Instructions=
* I've never installed a pre-release app before, but I hope you just need to drag and drop both the app and the provisioning profile onto iTunes on your desktop, and then sync.
