# EncycloClip

[EncycloClip™](http://itunes.apple.com/app/encycloclip/id368747595?mt=8)
for iPhone®, iPad®, and iPod Touch® is a faceless iPhone/iPad app by
[Flash Sheridan](http://pobox.com/~flash) which searches the online
version of the Encyclopædia Britannica® for the contents of your
clipboard. To use it, select and copy some text (for instance in an
eBook, web page, or your own notes); then launch EncycloClip™ from your
home screen. It is possible to do this manually from Safari by visiting
the m.eb.com website, but EncycloClip™ reduces the minimum tap count for
a lookup to two from eight (or six if you have added it to your Home
Screen), and eliminates an unnecessary web request.

EncycloClip™ is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with Encyclopædia
Britannica®. It merely facilitates access to their web site, which may require
a subscription or show advertisements,
and sometimes needs to scroll down to reveal its search
results. On recent iOS versions, launching Safari can sometimes take
several seconds; during this time a blank screen will be displayed.
